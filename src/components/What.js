        <h1>What is Halal Food</h1>
        <p>Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been prepared according to Islamic law. These rules state:
            <div className="list">
             <li>  The slaughterer must be a sane adult Muslim.</li> 
             <li>  The slaughterer must say the name of God before making the cut.</li> 
             <li>  The name of God is said in order to emphasise the sanctity of life and that the animal is being killed for food with God’s consent.</li> 
             <li>  The animal must be killed by cutting the throat with one continuous motion of a sharp knife.</li> 
             <li>  The cut must sever at least three of the trachea, oesophagus, and the two blood vessels on either side of the throat.</li> 
             <li>  The spinal cord must not be cut.</li> 
             <li>  Animals must be well treated before being killed.</li> 
             <li> Animals must not see other animals being killed.</li> 
             <li> The knife must not be sharpened in the animal’s presence.</li> 
             <li> The knife blade must be free of blemishes that might tear the wound.</li> 
             <li> The animal must not be in an uncomfortable position.</li> 
             <li> The animal must be allowed to bleed out and be completely dead before further processing.</li>
